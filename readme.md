Hi! I'm an economist with extensive skills in data analysis and visualization. Proficient in advanced Excel for data analysis, I excel in utilizing R and Python for both data extraction and analysis. Depending on the complexity of the problem at hand, I am adept at employing SQL for information transformations and Power BI for compelling presentations.
